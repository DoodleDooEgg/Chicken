    About,
    This website is a quick html site i made to hold utilities that can be used for us. Like announcments, Image archives and more.
    I will try to implement a communication feature. If i ever do manage to make it please keep it civil and dont make it like the "Previous website".
    Im going to work on the site today and a bit into the week, if i get nowhere i might cancel the project.
    Contact Lukemccarthy004@gmail.com for any questions.
